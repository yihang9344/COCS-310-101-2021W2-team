# COCS-310-101-2021W2-team interactive conversational agent
# Description
The project is an interactive dialogue agent for disease diagnosis and treatment, which will use various methods to respond to relevant user questions. The user can ask the agent questions about current physical condition and get brief diagnosis and suggestions. The role of the agent is to answer the relevant information that users need to know when they have physical abnormalities.
The structure of the project is to design questions and corresponding answers in advance, but it is not rigid. In the process of implementation, even the same question can be answered differently according to different situations. In this project, all input and output are completed in the console.
# Description and rationale for the chosen SDLC
Agile development SDLC is chosen in this project.
• Program specification, design and implementation are inter-leaved
• The system is developed as a series of versions or increments with stakeholders involved in version specification and evaluation
• Frequent delivery of new versions for evaluation
• Extensive tool support (e.g., automated testing tools) used to support development.
• Minimal documentation – focus on working code
This is the most suitable life cycle for a project with a small team allocation and a short project timeframe.

Limitations
The project is completely realized through mapping, so the problem must be the same as that designed in advance, and the submitted program has no ability to correct errors.
In addition, the answer to the nearest hospital is realized by random number, which is not true.
